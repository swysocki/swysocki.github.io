I love trying new tools, both physical and digital, to keep my environment fresh
and exciting. Honestly, nothing excites me more than becoming productive with new
software or hardware. I make tons of changes in my setup but not all of it sticks.
The following highlight some of the items that stood out to me in 2025, purposely
limited to my top 4 tools.

## Obsidian

I've used a ton of different note taking applications and always had frustrations
in one way or another. My requirements are so simple: I want to write in Markdown,
I want the application to be cross-platform, and I want all of my notes to
synchronize automatically. Over the years I have struggled to find an app that
meets my criteria _without_ trapping my notes in a proprietary format.

Obsidian has been popular for many years, but I had never taken the leap. I had
always seen it as a powerful "mind mapping" application, full of plugins and
extensions that I wouldn't need. As it turns out, I only need a handful of the
core plugins and it works beautifully for me. I can use it on my laptop, phone,
and tablet without issue, and I don't have to worry about my notes being trapped
in some binary format.

### Drawbacks

I purchased a subscription to [Obsidian Sync Standard](https://obsidian.md/sync),
which has performed well, but has 1 GB storage limit and a 5 MB file limit. For
this reason, I don't store images in my Obsidian notes.

## Shapr3D

I do a fair amount of CAD modeling as a hobby, not just for 3D printing, but also
for metal and wood working projects. I have saved myself many hours, and dollars,
by building my projects in CAD before purchasing materials. My main issue with
most CAD programs is that they are expensive and require powerful hardware to run.
This year, I want to try something reasonably priced that required lesser hardware
specs.

Shapr3D was a perfect fit. It can run on an iPad, Mac or PC with reasonable
hardware specs. The greatest advantage, for me, was the ability to use my iPad to
interact with my CAD models. Shapr3D's flexibility is was piqued my interest. I
can work at my desk, on a full PC workstation, and then make edits on my iPad,
using a pencil, while I'm in the workshop.

### Drawbacks

I occasionally do sheet metal work and Shapr3D does not have any sheet metal
tools. Other CAD programs will calculate K-factors, bends and flat patterns which
is a massive time saver.

## Bambu Lab X1 Carbon

I have used a 3D printer in my workshop for many years now. Like many enthusiasts
who started 3D printing in the 2010's, I began with a [Creality Ender 3
v2](https://www.creality.com/products/ender-3-v2-3d-printer-csco). This printer
was the gateway drug that got many of us started. It provided hope
that one day we could consistently print without toiling over the printer itself.
That was far from reality, 3D printers were a miserable experience in the past,
but along came [Bambu Lab](https://bambulab.com) and changed the game.

I bought the [X1 Carbon](https://bambulab.com/en/x1) with an AMS unit and haven't
enjoyed 3D printing more! Bambu Lab accomplished what we dreamed of a decade ago.
A 3D printer that felt more like sturdy tool than a project itself. I have printed
countless hours of various materials with very high confidence that the X1 Carbon
will deliver.

### Drawbacks

Bambu Lab executes very well on turning a hobbyist device into a reliable tool.
This comes with a compromise: you are very locked into Bambu Lab's supply chain.
There are some third party components available, but for the most part you are
stuck in the Bambu Lab's ecosystem.

## GitHub Copilot

AI Coding Agents have become a bit of an arms race this year. I see GitHub Copilot
as the OG, and while many say it has been left behind in the race, I found it the
most friction-free way to dip my toes in the AI agent water. I have been pushed
towards using Visual Studio Code for many reasons, and for many reasons Visual
Studio Code has force AI agents into its product, so it was nearly effortless to
begin using GitHub Copilot.

Adopting Copilot required a bit of effort, but its benefits largely overshadow any
friction that it caused. I found the free tier to be generous, but I purchased a
Pro subscription to get the full experience. I found that using the Claude Haiku
4.5 model was not only much faster, but tended to get things right on the first
try.

I have a long way to go before I consider myself an AI Coding Agent power user,
but I have still had a large boost in productivity thanks to Copilot. I may try
other IDE's or Agent integrations in the future, but Copilot made its impact on me
this year.

### Drawbacks

Copilot as an IntelliSense replacement is clumsy. I almost always lose the
suggestion, because hitting the `tab` key is awkward for me, and I struggle to
recreate the suggested completion again. I would appreciate a more predictable
interaction, similar to IntelliSense, than a complete shift in how completion
works.
