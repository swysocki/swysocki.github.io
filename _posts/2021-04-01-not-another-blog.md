title: Not Another Blog
tags:

I'm pretty sure the industry doesn't need another blog, but yet here we are. Honestly, I've always wanted to do this but have never followed through. I'm at that point where I would like to share my thoughts with a larger audience, maybe help a few people solve problems along the way. As an added benefit I will become a better writer and undoubtedly pick up some new skills.

My goal is to write something worth posting every month. It may be highly technical or just an observation that pertains to our industry.  I don't intend to focus on any particular topic because I would like to see what I naturally prefer to write about. So yeah, I really have no plan. 

Regardless, I hope you enjoy my blog. Feel free to contact me with any input you have. Technical corrections, spelling errors, grammatical mistakes are all fair game.  Feedback, good or bad, means I have accomplished my goal.
