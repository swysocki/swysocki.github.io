<h2>It's Good to be Back</h2>

<p>It’s been well over a year since I last wrote anything here and it feels good to be back. A lot has changed since then and I feel like I have something to write about again. For all of my followers (thanks Mom), rest assured, I will have some new content soon.</p>
<p>A bit of a spoiler: I have topics other than software to write about now. I’ve been spending a ton of time in my workshop recently and I feel it is time to write about some of my new distractions as well. I will have some of that content for those of you are interested in 3D modeling, printing or metal fabrication.</p>
<p>And lastly, I think it’s time for a site refresh. I really enjoyed writing <a href="https://github.com/swysocki/staffsergeant">my own static site generator</a> but it does present some friction when trying to post new content. At the end of the day, my goal is write and share ideas and concepts, not to build and maintain another service (I do that for my day job). Minimizing friction is one of my priorities.</p>
