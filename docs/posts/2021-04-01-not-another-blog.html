<h2>Not Another Blog</h2>

<p>I'm pretty sure the industry doesn't need another blog, but yet here we are. Honestly, I've always
wanted to do this but have never followed through. I'm at that point where I would like to share my
thoughts with a larger audience, and maybe help a few people solve problems along the way. As an
added benefit I will become a better writer and undoubtedly pick up some new skills.</p>
<p>My goal is to write something worth posting every month. It may be highly technical or just an
observation that pertains to our industry.  I don't intend to focus on any particular topic because
I would like to see what I naturally prefer to write about. So yeah, I have no plan.</p>
<p>Regardless, I hope you enjoy my blog. Feel free to contact me with any input you have. Technical
corrections, spelling errors, and grammatical mistakes are all fair game.  Feedback, good or
bad, means I have accomplished my goal.</p>
