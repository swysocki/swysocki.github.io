<h2>I Wrote a Static Site Generator</h2>

<p>It's not that great static site generators (SSG) don't exist.  Let's be honest,
<a href="https://jamstack.org/generators/">we don't need more of them</a>. But that has never
stopped me before.  The motivation here was that I wanted something simple, with
minimal dependencies, tailorable to my needs.  My previous SSG, <a href="jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>,
works seamlessly with Github pages, making it an easy choice.  But Jekyll has way more
features than I need, making it harder to modify and more dependencies to manage.</p>
<p>I had very minimal criteria for my SSG:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I wanted to use my Jekyll files as-is. I didn't want to change any of the content if
I could avoid it. That will make the transition simple and allow me to migrate elsewhere
if I want.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My generator would be written in Python. I may change this later but for now, Python
will get me there quicker.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>With that in mind, I needed to choose the building blocks of my generator.</p>
<h2>The Shoulders of Giants</h2>
<p>The process was simpler than I expected, it's almost like the components are just lying around waiting to be assembled.  So that is essentially what I did. I knew I was going
to write it in Python from the start, so I filled in the blanks with some solid,
off-the-shelf libraries.</p>
<h3>Markdown to HTML Library</h3>
<p>There are lots, but I chose <a href="https://github.com/executablebooks/markdown-it-py">markdown-it-py</a>
which seems vastly underrated. It's a port of the
<a href="https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it">markdown-it</a> Javascript library but doesn't
have quite as much traction.  Nonetheless, it has all the pieces I need.  The most
notable feature is the plugin system. I use the Plugin Extensions to read Markdown
<a href="https://mdit-py-plugins.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#front-matter">Front Matter</a>.
My old Jekyll posts contain Front Matter that I don't want to lose, so this piece is
important.</p>
<h3>Template Library</h3>
<p>This is a no-brainer in Python, it's <a href="https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/">Jinja</a>.
Jinja is about as ubiquitous as a third-party library gets. It has everything you could
want from a templating library and I have a great deal of experience with it from other
projects.</p>
<h2>Putting it Together</h2>
<p>I wrote what I assume is the typical formula for a generator:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read in Markdown files, converting them to HTML</li>
<li>Add the converted HTML to templates</li>
<li>Output the template to HTML files</li>
</ul>
<p>With just a bit of Python &quot;glue&quot; was able to give myself a minimally functioning
generator in about 150 lines of code. It's nothing beautiful, but it's functional
and once I wire up CI/CD it will be automatic.</p>
<p>Unnecessary, sure but that wasn't the point. It was a fun little project and I'm
excited to continue extending <a href="https://github.com/swysocki/staffsergeant">Staff Sergeant</a>
(because it's an SSG, get it?).</p>
